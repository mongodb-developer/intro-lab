This application uses an Angular front end and a Node.js or Java Spring Boot back end. The application is already built and deployed to a GitHub codespace, so you won't need to install anything in your local environment. You will be able to access the application from your browser. Our library management application leverages the data modeling patterns you'll explore throughout this workshop. As you navigate through the application, you'll witness how these patterns come to life, enhancing both the user experience and the efficiency of the system. The application enables users to explore a rich catalog of books, search for specific titles, delve into book details, and even share their thoughts through comments. Users can also reserve books for future reading. Behind the scenes, MongoDB's data modeling patterns play a crucial role in ensuring the application's flexibility, scalability, and performance. For library employees, an admin panel offers functionalities like managing book checkouts and returns. As we guide you through the application, you'll discover how the various design patterns we've discussed so far are seamlessly integrated to optimize data storage, retrieval, and overall system performance.

You will see a function that applies the schema to the users collection. console.log('Applying schema validation for users...'); const resultUsers = await db.command({ collMod: 'users', validator: { $jsonSchema: userSchema }, validationLevel: 'strict', validationAction: 'error' }); The function uses the db.command() method to apply the schema to the users collection. The collMod option specifies the collection to which the schema should be applied.The validator option specifies the JSON schema to use for validation. This is the userSchema object declared just above.The validationLevel option specifies the level of validation to perform. This could be strict or moderate. If you set it to strict, the document will be inserted and updated only if it passes validation.If you set it to moderate, updates to existing documents in the collection that don't match the validation rules aren't checked for validity. And finally, the validationAction option specifies the action to take when a document fails validation. This could be error or warn. If you set it to error, MongoDB rejects any insert or update that violates the validation criteria.If you set it to warn, the operation proceeds, but the violation is recorded in the MongoDB log.
