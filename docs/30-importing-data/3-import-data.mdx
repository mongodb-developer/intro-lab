# 👐 Importing the library data

Now that you have your connection string, you can import the library data into your project.

To do this, we've built a small utility that will copy the data from our database, into your cluster. This is why you'll need to provide this application with your connection string.

:::caution
You should never share your connection string with anyone. It contains your database credentials, and anyone with access to it can read and write data to your database.
:::

To import the data, start by going to the [importer application](https://mdb.link/import-library-data).

You will be greeted by this minimalistic interface.

Paste your connection string into the input field, and click the **Import Library Data** button.

You should see a message saying that the import has started.

```
Starting data import
```

:::note
This will take approximately 5 minutes. Time to get a coffee!
:::

After a few minutes, you should see that the import job was successful.
