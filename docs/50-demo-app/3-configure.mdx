# 👐 Configure the Application

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="🚀 NodeJS/Express">

Now that your environment is set up, you can explore it.

### Local MongoDB instance

There should already be a file open in the IDE. If not, look in the file explorer on the left, and open the file below. This file contains the configuration for the application.

File: `server/.env`

```
PORT=5400
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
DATABASE_NAME=library
SECRET=secret
```

The `DATABASE_URI` parameter is already set to `mongodb://localhost:27017`, which connects to a local MongoDB Atlas deployment running inside the Codespace sandbox.

To explore the database and the imported dataset, click the leaf icon in the left sidebar to open the MongoDB extension. You’ll see a preset connection called **"Library DB"**. Expand it and browse the collections in the **library** database.


In the *Terminal* tab at the bottom, look for the line `Server is running on port: 5400`. If it appears, the Node.js API for the library application is up and ready to serve requests.

You’ve already seen the client-side website for the library, running in the preview tab. Feel free to click around and explore the different pages.

Verify that your server application is running and the server port is set to "Public".

## Reload the client

Now that the server is running, you can reload the client to see the application.

In the upper right panel, click the refresh icon to reload the client.

Clicking this will reload the client, which should now be connected to the database. You should see the application with some books listed now.

## Open the client in a new window

If you accidentally close the Client or want to open it in a separate tab/window go to the Ports tab, hover over Client and a world icon should appear. Click it and the client will open in a new tab.
