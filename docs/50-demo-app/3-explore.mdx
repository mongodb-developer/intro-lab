# 👐 Explore the Dataset

Now that your environment is set up, you can explore it.

## Local MongoDB instance

The database you'll be using in this exercise is a local MongoDB Atlas deployment running inside the codespace's sandbox.

To explore the database and the imported dataset, click the leaf icon on the left sidebar to open the MongoDB extension. You’ll see a preset connection called **"Library DB"**. Expand it and browse the collections in the **library** database.

You can open the pre-loaded documents in the collections. For example, expand the `books` collection and open a document of your choice. This will open a JSON preview of the document in the editor. You can even edit the document in the editor - saving the file will update the document in the database.
