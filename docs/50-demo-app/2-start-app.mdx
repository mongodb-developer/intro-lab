# üëê Start the Application

You have two options to start the application.

## Option 1: Run in a codespace

By far, the easiest way to start the application is to run it in a codespace. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that you can connect to from Visual Studio Code. It comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to build and run the application.

In the case of this application, you can even use the online IDE to edit the code and see the changes reflected in the running application.

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="üöÄ NodeJS/Express">

Open the [repository on the `main` branch](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system).

To start the application in a codespace, click "Code." Then, look for the *Codespaces* tab. Click "Create Codespace on main." This will create a new codespace for you and start the application.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the containers, and run the installation scripts. Once it's ready, you'll see an IDE, with a preview window that shows the running application.

:::warning
Right now, you should see a big error message in the console, as we haven't configured the app yet. Don't worry, you'll get it up and running in a few minutes.

### Expose the server port

To get the application working in that environment, there is one small change you need to make to the codespace. You need to expose the port where the server is running.

Look for the *Ports* tab at the bottom of the IDE.

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/50-demo-app/2-start-app/3-ports.png" alt="The Ports tab" />

Once you click on the tab, you'll see a list of ports. Right-click on the port `Server (5000)` row. Then, select "Port Visibility" and "Public."

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/50-demo-app/2-start-app/4-port-visibility.png" alt="The Port Visibility menu" />

You'll see the text in the *Visibility* column change to `Public`.

That's it! You're now ready to move to the next section.

<TabItem value="java" label="‚òïÔ∏è Java Spring Boot">

Open the [repository on the `java-server` branch](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/tree/java-server).

To start the Java application in a codespace, check that you are in the `java-server` branch and then click "Code." Then, look for the *Codespaces* tab. Click "Create Codespace on java-server." This will create a new codespace for you and start the application.

### Set the MongoDB connection
To run the application in GitHub Codespaces, you now need to set the MongoDB connection string before starting the server.
In the terminal of your Codespace, run:
```
export MONGODB_URI="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>"
```
After setting the environment variable, start the application again with:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/50-demo-app/2-start-app/5-set-environments.png" alt="Set environment variable" />
Once the command finishes, the application will be up and running on port 5000.

## ü¶∏ Option 2: Run locally

If you prefer to run the application locally, you can do so by following these steps. Keep in mind that the following steps of this lab will be using the codespace, so you might need to adapt some of the commands.

:::info

During the lab, we will use GitHub Codespaces. These instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or you _really, really, really_ want a local installation.

:::

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:mongodb-developer/library-management-system.git
```

Then, change to the `library-management-system` directory.

```
cd library-management-system
```

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="üöÄ NodeJS/Express">

Now, go to each of the `client` and `server` directories and install the dependencies.

```
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

Start the server application.

```
npm start
```

And, in another terminal window, start the client application.

```
cd client
npm start
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="‚òïÔ∏è Java Spring Boot">

1. Before starting the backend, switch to the java-server project.
```
    git checkout java-server
```
This command moves you into the correct project folder that contains the Java backend code.

2. Set the MongoDB connection string as an environment variable:
   - On Linux / macOS:
   ```
    export MONGODB_URI="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>"
    ````

    - On Windows:
    ```
    $env:MONGODB_URI="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>"
    ```

3. Run the Java server:
    ```
    cd java-server
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4. Run the client:
    ```    
    (cd ../client && npm install && npm start)
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You now have the client running on http://localhost:4200 and the server running on http://localhost:5000.
