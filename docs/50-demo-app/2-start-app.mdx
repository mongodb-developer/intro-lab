# 👐 Start the application

Go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system) for the demo application. From there, you have two options to start the application.

## Option 1: Run in a Codespace

:::info

🚀 __Express start: [click here](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/library-management-system?quickstart=1) to start a new Codespace or resume your last one!__

:::


By far, the easiest way to start the application is to run it in a Codespace. A Codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that you can connect to from Visual Studio Code. It comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to build and run the application.

In the case of this application, you can even use the online IDE to edit the code and see the changes reflected in the running application.

To start the application in a Codespace, click on the *Code* button. Then, look for the *Codespaces* tab. Click on the *Create Codespace on main* button. This will create a new Codespace for you and start the application.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the containers, and run the installation scripts. Once it's ready, you'll see an IDE, with a preview window that shows the running application.

Again, this might take a few minutes. It's a great time to grab a coffee ☕️

### Expose the server port

In order to get the application working in that environment, there is one small change you need to make to the codespace. You need to expose the port where the server is running.

Look for the *Ports* tab in the bottom of the IDE.

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/50-demo-app/2-start-app/3-ports.png" alt="Screenshot of the Ports tab" />

Once you click on the tab, you'll see a list of ports. Right-click on the port `Server (5000)` row. Then select *Port Visibility* and then *Public*.

You'll see the text in the *Visibility* column change to `Public`.

That's it, you're now ready to move to the next section.


## 🦸 Option 2: Run locally

If you prefer to run the application locally, you can do so by following these steps. Keep in mind that the following steps of this lab will be using the Codespace, so you might need to adapt some of the commands.

:::info

During the lab we will use GitHub Codespaces, these instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or you _really really really_ want a local installation.

:::

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mongodb-developer/library-management-system.git
```

Then, change to the `library-management-system` directory.

```bash
cd library-management-system
```

Now go to each of the `client` and `server` directories and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

Start the server application.

```bash
npm start
```

And, in another terminal window, start the client application.

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

You now have the client running on http://localhost:4200, and the server running on http://localhost:5000.
