# 👐 Start the Application

You have two options to start the application.

## Option 1: Run in Instruqt

Instruqt is a lab platform that provides cloud-based sandboxes which come pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab.

Navigate to the Instruqt lab using [this link](https://mdb.link/instruqt-library).

Fill out the form that appears and click **Submit and access**.

Click **Start** to launch the lab environment.

You should see a screen with a purple progress bar indicating that Instruqt is preparing a sandbox with all the required libraries for this lab and a MongoDB database.

Once this is done, you should see a **Start** button at the bottom right of the screen. Click this to enter the lab.

## Option 2: Run in a codespace

If Instruqt is not working for you, you can also use GitHub Codespaces. A GitHub Codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that you can connect to from Visual Studio Code. It comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to build and run the application.

Similar to Instruqt, you can even use Codespaces as an online IDE to edit the code and see the changes reflected in the running application.

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="🚀 NodeJS/Express">

Open the [repository on the `main` branch](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system).

To start the application in a codespace, click "Code." Then, look for the *Codespaces* tab. Click "Create Codespace on main." This will create a new codespace for you and start the application.

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/50-demo-app/2-start-app/1-codespace.png" alt="Create codespace button" />

Let it run for a few minutes as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the containers, and run the installation scripts. Once it's ready, you'll see an IDE, with a preview window that shows the running application.

Once the command finishes, the application will be running on port 5400.

In the *Terminal* tab at the bottom, look for the line `Server is running on port: 5400`. If it appears, the Node.js API for the library application is up and ready to serve requests.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="☕️ Java Spring Boot">

Open the [repository on the `java-server` branch](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/tree/java-server).

To start the Java application in a codespace, check that you are in the `java-server` branch and then click "Code." Then, look for the *Codespaces* tab. Click "Create Codespace on java-server." This will create a new codespace for you and start the application.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the containers, and run the installation scripts. Once it's ready, you'll see an IDE, with a preview window that shows the running application.

</Tabs>

### Access the library website

Once the environment loads, you may see the following warning:

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/50-demo-app/2-start-app/7-visit-page.png" alt="A warning in the codespace saying 'You are about to access a development port served by someone's codespace'" />

You're seeing this warning because the development server is running on a publicly forwarded port, and GitHub shows a security notice anytime someone accesses a public port. Even in your own codespace, GitHub displays it just to confirm you intended to open that external-facing URL.

Click "Continue" to load the library application website. 

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/50-demo-app/3-configure/2-reload.png" alt="The refresh icon" />

You should see the application with some books listed now.

### Open the client in a new window

If you accidentally close the Client or want to open it in a separate tab/window go to the Ports tab, hover over Client and a world icon should appear. Click it and the client will open in a new tab.

## 🦸 Option 3: Run locally

If you prefer to run the application locally, you can do so by following these steps. Keep in mind that the following steps of this lab will be using Instruqt or the GitHub codespace, so you might need to adapt some of the commands.

:::info

During the lab, we will use Instruqt or GitHub Codespaces. These instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or you _really, really, really_ want a local installation.

:::

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:mongodb-developer/library-management-system.git
```

Then, change to the `library-management-system` directory.

```
cd library-management-system
```

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="🚀 NodeJS/Express">

Now, go to each of the `client` and `server` directories and install the dependencies.

```
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

Start the server application.

```
npm start
```

And, in another terminal window, start the client application.

```
cd client
npm start
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="☕️ Java Spring Boot">

1. Before starting the backend, switch to the java-server project.
    ```
    git checkout java-server
    ```
    This command moves you into the correct project folder that contains the Java backend code.

2. Set the MongoDB connection string as an environment variable:
   - On Linux / macOS:
   ```
    export MONGODB_URI="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>"
    ````

    - On Windows:
    ```
    $env:MONGODB_URI="<YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING>"
    ```

3. Run the Java server:
    ```
    cd java-server
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

4. Run the client:
    ```    
    (cd ../client && npm install && npm start)
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You now have the client running on http://localhost:4200 and the server running on http://localhost:5000.
