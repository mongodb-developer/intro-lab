# 👐 Build a compound index following the ESR rule

:::info
Note for Java users: we will create indexes via a Javascript script! Although there's nothing stopping us to write this code in Java, this is usually a DB Admin task.
:::

In this exercise, you will build a compound index following the ESR rule, compare the query explain plans before and after creating the index, and analyze them.

## Explore the code

1. Open the file `server/src/indexing/borrowed-books-index.ts` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/src/indexing/borrowed-books-index.ts) in your GitHub Codespace.

2. Examine the code to build a compound index on the `borrowedBooks` collection.

    ```js
    /**
    * Create the index to support the following query:
    * issueDetails.find({
    *    'user._id': userID,
    *   borrowDate: { $gte: date },
    * }, {
    *  sort: { returnedDate: -1 }
    * })
    */
    await collections?.issueDetails?.createIndex({
        // Equality
        'user._id': 1,
        // Sort
        returnedDate: 1,
        // Range
        borrowDate: 1,
    });
    ```

    :::info
    The index is created on the `borrowedBooks` collection to support the query that finds the issue details for a user with a specific `userID`, where the `borrowDate` is greater than or equal to a specific `date`, and sorts the results by `returnedDate` in descending order.

    This is compound index and it follows the ESR rule: Equality, Sort, and Range. This ensures optimal performance for the query.
    :::

3. Execute the script to create the compound index.

    ```bash
    npx tsx src/indexing/borrowed-books-index.ts
    ```

    After a few seconds, you should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Connecting to MongoDB Atlas...
    Connected!

    BEFORE creating the index

    Winning plan stage: COLLSCAN
    No index used
    Total documents examined: 1284
    Number of documents returned: 3

    -----------------------------

    AFTER creating the index

    Winning plan stage: IXSCAN
    Index used: user._id_1_returnedDate_1_borrowDate_1
    Total documents examined: 3
    Number of documents returned: 3
    ```

    :::info
    The script uses [explain plans](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.explain/) to compare the query plans before and after creating the index.

    Notice the difference in the winning plan stage and the number of documents examined before and after creating the index.
    :::

## 🦸‍♀️ Try different indexes

Modify the compound index by adding and removing fields, and observe the changes in the query explain plans.
