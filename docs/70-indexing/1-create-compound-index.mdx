# 👐 Build a compound index following the ESR rule

In this exercise, you will build a compound index following the ESR rule, compare the query explain plans before and after creating the index, and analyze them.

## Explore the code


<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="🚀 NodeJS/Express">

1. Open the file `server/src/indexing/borrowed-books-index.ts` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/src/indexing/borrowed-books-index.ts) in your GitHub Codespace.

2. Examine the code to build a compound index on the `issueDetails` collection.

    ```js
    /**
    * Create the index to support the following query:
    * issueDetails.find({
    *    'user._id': userID,
    *   borrowDate: { $gte: date },
    * }, {
    *  sort: { returnedDate: -1 }
    * })
    */
    await collections?.issueDetails?.createIndex({
        // Equality
        'user._id': 1,
        // Sort
        returnedDate: 1,
        // Range
        borrowDate: 1,
    });
    ```

    :::info
    The index is created on the `issueDetails` collection to support the query that finds the issue details for a user with a specific `userID`, where the `borrowDate` is greater than or equal to a specific `date`, and sorts the results by `returnedDate` in descending order.

    This is compound index and it follows the ESR rule: Equality, Sort, and Range. This ensures optimal performance for the query.
    :::

3. Execute the script to create the compound index.

    ```bash
    npx tsx src/indexing/borrowed-books-index.ts
    ```

    After a few seconds, you should see the following output:

    ```bash
    Connecting to MongoDB Atlas...
    Connected!

    BEFORE creating the index

    Winning plan stage: COLLSCAN
    No index used
    Total documents examined: 1284
    Number of documents returned: 3

    -----------------------------

    AFTER creating the index

    Winning plan stage: IXSCAN
    Index used: user._id_1_returnedDate_1_borrowDate_1
    Total documents examined: 3
    Number of documents returned: 3
    ```

    :::info
    The script uses [explain plans](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.explain/) to compare the query plans before and after creating the index.

    Notice the difference in the winning plan stage and the number of documents examined before and after creating the index.

1. Open the file `java-server/java-server/src/main/java/com/mongodb/devrel/library/model/IssueDetail.java` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/java-server/java-server/src/main/java/com/mongodb/devrel/library/model/IssueDetail.java) in your GitHub Codespace.

1. Examine the code to build a compound index on the `issueDetails` collection.

    ```java
    // add these imports
    import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.index.Indexed;
    import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.index.CompoundIndex;

    // ...
    // Add the CompoundIndex annotation
    @CompoundIndex(name = "user_returned_borrow_idx", def = "{'user._id': 1, 'returnedDate': 1, 'borrowDate': 1}")
    public class IssueDetail {
        // ...

        // Constructors, Getters, Setters
    }
    ```

    :::info
    The index is created on the `issueDetails` collection to support the query that finds the issue details for a user with a specific `userID`, where the `borrowDate` is greater than or equal to a specific `date`, and sorts the results by `returnedDate` in descending order.

    This is compound index and it follows the ESR rule: Equality, Sort, and Range. This ensures optimal performance for the query.
    :::
1. Add to `application.properties` this line to enable automatic creation of indexes

    ```
    spring.data.mongodb.auto-index-creation=true
    ```
1. Stop the running app.
    1. Locate the bottom panel and click on the `TERMINAL` tab.
    1. Press Ctrl+C to interrup the running app

1. Restart the app typing in the Terminal:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:start
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 🦸‍♀️ Try different indexes

Modify the compound index by adding and removing fields, and observe the changes in the query explain plans.
