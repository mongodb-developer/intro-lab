# 🦸‍♀️ Enable validation for the authors collection

In this exercise, you will define a JSON schema for the authors collection, apply the schema to the collection, and test the schema validation by inserting a document that does not match the schema.

This is an advanced exercises that requires you to write code. If you get stuck and you're doing this during a live workshop, you can flag down an instructor in the room for help.

1. Start by opening the the `server/src/schema-validation/apply-schema.ts` file in your GitHub Codespace and uncomment lines 41-61.
1. Complete the tasks marked with `// TODO` comments.
1. Execute the script again to apply the schema to the `authors` collection.
    ```bash
    cd server
    node dist/schema-validation/apply-schema.js 

    ```
1. Finally, test the schema validation by inserting a document that does not match the schema.
