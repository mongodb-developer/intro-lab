#  üëê Enable Validation for the Users Collection

In this exercise, you will explore the pre-written JSON validation schema for the `users` collection, run a script to apply it to the collection, and test the schema validation by inserting a document that does not match the schema.

## Database user permissions

To update the validator for any database collection, your database user must have admin privileges. Follow these steps to ensure your user has the correct permissions:

1. Open the [Atlas UI](https://cloud.mongodb.com?utm_campaign=devrel&utm_source=workshop&utm_medium=cta&utm_content=developer.day&utm_term=project.phoenix).
2. In the left-hand menu, navigate to **Network Settings** and select "Database Access."
3. Locate your database user in the list. Check the **MongoDB Roles** column for the role of the user you are using for this workshop. If the role is not **atlasAdmin@admin**, you will need to update it.
4. If the role is not **atlasAdmin@admin**, click "Edit" button next to the user.
5. Scroll down to the **Database User Privileges** section and expand the **Built-in Role** dropdown.
6. Select "Atlas admin" from the dropdown menu.
7. Click "Update User" to save the changes.

Atlas will deploy the change in a few seconds.

## Explore the JSON schema

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="üöÄ NodeJS/Express">

The JSON schema for the `users` collection is stored in the `server/src/schema-validation/apply-schema.ts` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/src/schema-validation/apply-schema.ts). Open the file in your GitHub codespace and examine the schema.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="‚òïÔ∏è Java Spring Boot">

JSON schema for the `users` collection:

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```ts
const userSchema = {
    bsonType: 'object',
    required: ['name', 'isAdmin'],
    properties: {
        name: {
            bsonType: 'string',
            minLength: 5,
            description: 'must be a string and is required'
        },
        isAdmin: {
            bsonType: 'bool',
            description: 'must be a boolean and is required'
        }
    }
};
```

The schema defines the following constraints:
- The required fields are `name` and `isAdmin`.
- The `name` field must be a string with a minimum length of five characters.
- The `isAdmin` field must be a boolean.

## Explore the script to apply the schema

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="üöÄ NodeJS/Express">

Examine the lines immediately following the schema definition in the `apply-schema.ts` file. You will see a function that applies the schema to the `users` collection.

```js
console.log('Applying schema validation for users...');
const resultUsers = await db.command({
    collMod: 'users',
    validator: {
        $jsonSchema: userSchema
    },
    validationLevel: 'strict',
    validationAction: 'error'
});
```

The function uses the `db.command()` method to apply the schema to the `users` collection.
- The `collMod` option specifies the collection to which the schema should be applied.
- The `validator` option specifies the JSON schema to use for validation. This is the `userSchema` object declared just above.
- The `validationLevel` option specifies the level of validation to perform. This could be `strict` or `moderate`.
    - If you set it to `strict`, the document will be inserted and updated only if it passes validation.
    - If you set it to `moderate`, updates to existing documents in the collection that don't match the validation rules aren't checked for validity.
- And finally, the `validationAction` option specifies the action to take when a document fails validation. This could be `error` or `warn`.
    - If you set it to `error`, MongoDB rejects any insert or update that violates the validation criteria.
    - If you set it to `warn`, the operation proceeds, but the violation is recorded in the MongoDB log.

<TabItem value="java" label="‚òïÔ∏è Java Spring Boot">
In this step, we‚Äôll review the code that applies schema validation to the users collection.
It‚Äôs already implemented in `SchemaValidationConfig.java` no changes needed. We‚Äôll look at two methods:
```java title='infrastructure/config/SchemaValidationConfig'
@Configuration
public class SchemaValidationConfig {

    // fields ..

    private void applyUserSchema(MongoDatabase db)  {
       // implementation
    }

    private void runCollMod(MongoDatabase db, String collection, Document schema) {
       // implementation
    }

}
```
- `applyUserSchema(MongoDatabase db)`
  - Ensures the users collection exists.
  - Builds a $jsonSchema requiring name (string, minLength: 5) and isAdmin (boolean).
  - Calls runCollMod(...) to attach the validator to the collection.

- `runCollMod(MongoDatabase db, String collection, Document schema)`
  - Executes collMod with validator, validationLevel=strict, and validationAction=error.



For readability, only the class structure is shown above. 
You can open the [SchemaValidationConfig](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/java-server/java-server/src/main/java/com/mongodb/devrel/library/infrastructure/config/SchemaValidationConfig.java) in your project to review the complete implementation.

## Apply the schema to the `users` collection

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="üöÄ NodeJS/Express">

You need to run the script to apply the schema to the `users` collection.

1. Open a new terminal emulator tab in your GitHub codespace. 
    1. Locate the bottom panel and click on the `TERMINAL` tab.
    1. Locate the `+` icon on the top right of the terminal panel and click on it to open a new terminal tab.
    1. Click on the new terminal tab to activate it.

1. Run the following command to apply the schema to the `users` collection:

    ```sh
    cd server
    npx tsx src/schema-validation/apply-schema.ts

    ```

    You might be prompted to allow pasting into the terminal. Click "Allow" to paste the command.

    Click "Enter" to run the command. After a few seconds, you should see the following output:

    ```sh
    Connecting to MongoDB Atlas...
    Connected!

    Applying schema validation for users...
    Schema validation enabled!
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="‚òïÔ∏è Java Spring Boot">

The `applyUserSchema` method is triggered by the [execute](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/java-server/java-server/src/main/java/com/mongodb/devrel/library/infrastructure/config/SchemaValidationConfig.java#L44) method, which runs only if the property `lab.schema-mode` is set.
To apply the schema, you must set this property to **apply**.

Stop the application if it‚Äôs running and restart it with:

```java
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dlab.schema-mode=apply"
```

When the application starts, you should see a message confirming that the validator was successfully applied to the users collection:
<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/60-schema-validation/1-schema-applied.png" alt="The schema validation applied" />


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::caution
If you see an error related to your user permissions, go back to the [Database User Permissions](#database-user-permissions) section and update your user permissions.
:::

## Test the schema validation

<Tabs groupId="server">
<TabItem value="node" label="üöÄ NodeJS/Express">

Now that the schema validation is enabled for the `users` collection, you can test it by inserting a document that does not match the schema.

1. Open the file `server/src/schema-validation/test-validation.ts` [file](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/main/server/src/schema-validation/test-validation.ts).
2. Explore the call to the `insertOne()` function around line 12 that will try to insert a new user and the error handling code around line 18.
3. Execute the script by running the following command.

  ```sh
  npx tsx src/schema-validation/test-validation.ts
  ```

The error describes that the `name` and `isAdmin` fields are required but missing in the document you tried to insert.

Modify the script to insert a document again with the `name` and `isAdmin` fields and you should see the document inserted successfully.


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="java" label="‚òïÔ∏è Java Spring Boot">
In this step, the schema is already created, and it‚Äôs time to test it.
The [validateUserSchema](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system/blob/java-server/java-server/src/main/java/com/mongodb/devrel/library/infrastructure/config/SchemaValidationConfig.java#L97) method, already implemented, tries to insert a new user without the isAdmin field.

To trigger it, stop the application if it‚Äôs running and start it again with the property set to **test**:

```java
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dlab.schema-mode=test"
```

In the logs, you should see an error indicating that the insert was rejected by the validator:

<Screenshot url="https://github.com/mongodb-developer/library-management-system" src="img/screenshots/60-schema-validation/2-schema-validated.png" alt="The schema validation applied" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Summary

In this exercise, you explored the JSON schema for the `users` collection, ran a script to apply the schema to the collection, and tested the schema validation by inserting a document that does not match the schema.

In the next exercise, you will enable schema validation for the `authors` collection.
